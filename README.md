# Welcome to the Cafe Flavor List Project!

Hey there! This is a fun little project built with Django to help manage and showcase a variety of cafe flavors. Whether you're a cafe owner or just someone who loves exploring new flavors, this app has got you covered.

## What You Can Do Here

- **Search for Flavors**: Easily find flavors by typing in the search bar. You can also filter by season!
- **Check Out Details**: Click on any flavor to see more about it, including a description and price.
- **Add to Cart**: If you're logged in, you can add flavors to your cart for a future order.

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need

- **Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
- **Django**: This app runs on Django 3.x or later.
- **Virtual Environment**: It's a good idea to use `venv` or `virtualenv` to keep your dependencies organized.

### Setting It Up

1. **Clone the Project**

   First, grab a copy of the project:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cafe-flavor-list.git
   cd cafe-flavor-list
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment**

   Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the Goodies**

   Get all the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Get the Database Ready**

   Apply the migrations to set up your database:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create an Admin User**

   You'll want to access the admin panel, so create a superuser:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Fire Up the Server**

   Start the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Dive In!**

   Open your browser and head to `http://localhost:8000/` to see the app in action.
